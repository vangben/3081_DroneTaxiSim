## Getting Started

Here is a quick overview of how to run the visualization (These steps are similar in each build environment.  See below for environment details.):

    ```bash
    # Go to the project directory
    cd /path/to/repo/project

    # Build the project
    make -j

    # Run the project (./build/web-app <port> <web folder>)
    ./build/bin/transit_service 8081 apps/transit_service/web/
    ```
Open up two browser tabs:<br>
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html and you should see a page to schedule the trips. <br>
    a. Enter a name and click on <strong>only</strong> two locations on the 
    google maps image. Then click schedule.<br>
    b. Switch to the browser tab with the URL below. <br>
2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 and you should see a visualization.  You can move and pan the camera with left and right mouse buttons.  <br>
    a. At the top right you can select an entity (drones or robots) that the camera will focus on during the simulation.<br>
    b. After first scheduling a trip, the drone should move towards the robot.<br>

## Description of Project and Refactored files
Over the course of the entire semester, we learned to understand and refactor existing code to implement the larger ideas learned in class. The given code included all of the front end and most of the back end for this drone taxi system simulation. In summary, the base code uses choose a path to follow based on the user's choices during scheduling, the drone then moves towards the robot, and then moves it from it's start to final position. This process repeats if more trips are scheduled. <br><br>
The goal of the final project was to refactor the simulation to do something "interesting". Our team decided to use the decorator design pattern to create a "Wallet" for the robot that will pay for the drone taxi system. For every few units of distance traveled, the robot's wallet balance decreases and if it hits zero, the drone immediately drops off the robot before it reaches its destination. Below are the changes we made to the given code:<br>
1. added new file: /project/libs/transit/src/WalletDecorator.cc
2. added new file: /project/libs/transit/include/WalletDecorator.h
3. Multiple changes to the 4 strategy .cc and .h files
4. Changes in drone.cc and drone.hh to call the Robot's Pay() methods<br>

To see our changes, you can view the print statements in the terminal during the scheduling and drone simulation. Robots are generated with a 50% chance to either be a celebrity or a poor bot. Celebrities automatically get the beeline strategy movement - they move straight from point A to point B, regardless of the road/water, and pay nothing.<br><br> Poor bots on the other hand must travel via the roads as if they were traveling by car and must pay the drone a fee. Poor bot's wallet balance are randomly generated to be between 1 and 100. 

## Sprint Retrospective 
### Throughout the final project we practiced using a sprint and using SCRUM through Jira Boards. Below is our reflection on the sprint.

We had meetings even if we couldn't meet in person thanks to discord.
The J4 sprint board was a good way to organize tasks at the beginning,
even if we ended up not using it much.

We weren't able to stick closely to the sprint because the project didn't have
too many moving parts.

What we could do better if there was another sprint would be to fully utilize the J4
board. Which would require us to work individually more.

What we've learned is a lot of practice with C++ and the intricacies of inheriting and debugging.
Learned more of how to refactor code and make our own decorator pattern.
Sprints for really big projects take a lot of communication.

## Disclaimer/Bugs
- If you would like to restart the simulation you must first refresh the simulation browser tab and <strong>then</strong> the schedule.html tab. Otherwise, multiple bugs arise including the robots acting as drones. <br>
- Our current implementation works for the beeline strategy when scheduling using schedule.html, but there may be some bugs in the other strategies.
